-## Documentation
-
-https://hueble.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
-
-
-## Installation
-
-
-### PIP
-
-```
-pip install HueBLE
-```
-
-
-### Manual
-
-HueBLE consists of a single file (HueBLE.py) which you can simply put in the
-same directory as your program. If you are using manual installation make sure
-the dependencies are installed as well.
-
-```
-pip install bleak bleak-retry-connector
-```
-
-
-## Examples
-
-
-### Quick start example
-
-Example code from example.py
-
-```python
-import asyncio
-from bleak import BleakScanner
-import HueBLE
-
-
-async def main():
-
-    # Address of light to connect to
-    address = "F6:9B:48:A4:D2:D8"
-
-    # Obtain the BLEDevice from bleak
-    device = await BleakScanner.find_device_by_address(address)
-
-    # Initialize the light object
-    light = HueBLE.HueBleLight(device)
-
-    # Optionally we could call connect but it will be called automatically
-    # on the first request to the light. You might want to call this if
-    # you want to subscribe to state changes without changing the lights state.
-    # await light.connect()
-
-    # Will automatically connect to the light and turn it off
-    await light.set_power(False)
-
-    # Wait
-    await asyncio.sleep(5)
-
-    # Turn the light back on again
-    await light.set_power(True)
-
-if __name__ == "__main__":
-    asyncio.run(main())
-

-
-## Installation
-
-
-### PIP
-
-```
-pip install HueBLE
-```
-
-
-### Manual
-
-HueBLE consists of a single file (HueBLE.py) which you can simply put in the
-same directory as your program. If you are using manual installation make sure
-the dependencies are installed as well.
-
-```
-pip install bleak bleak-retry-connector
-```
-
-
-## Examples
-
-
-### Quick start example
-
-Example code from example.py
-
-```python
-import asyncio
-from bleak import BleakScanner
-import HueBLE
-
-
-async def main():
-
-    # Address of light to connect to
-    address = "F6:9B:48:A4:D2:D8"
-
-    # Obtain the BLEDevice from bleak
-    device = await BleakScanner.find_device_by_address(address)
-
-    # Initialize the light object
-    light = HueBLE.HueBleLight(device)
-
-    # Optionally we could call connect but it will be called automatically
-    # on the first request to the light. You might want to call this if
-    # you want to subscribe to state changes without changing the lights state.
-    # await light.connect()
-
-    # Will automatically connect to the light and turn it off
-    await light.set_power(False)
-
-    # Wait
-    await asyncio.sleep(5)
-
-    # Turn the light back on again
-    await light.set_power(True)
-
-if __name__ == "__main__":
-    asyncio.run(main())
